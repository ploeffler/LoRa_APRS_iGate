This Fork of richonguzman/LoRa_APRS_iGate/ is based on V2.3 of his firmware.

New in this fork is a more bi-directional view on the iGate-functionality in detail: all position pakets that come form IS are gated to the LoRa interface (not only objects). This leads to a much better useability for stations that have their tracker connected to a device with map(s) and is therefore ideal for blackout, offgrid and offline (internet) of the users in the field.
